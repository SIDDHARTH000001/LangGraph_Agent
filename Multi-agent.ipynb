Just enter the chosen number and read the results. Everything is\\\\ncalculated **quickly and automatically**! With this tool, you can also\\\\nestimate the square of the desired number (just enter the value into the\\\\nsecond field), which may be a great help in finding **perfect squares** from\\\\nthe square root formula.\\\\n\\\\nAre you struggling with the basic arithmetic operations: adding square roots,\\\\nsubtracting square roots, multiplying square roots, or dividing square roots?\\\\nNot anymore! In the following text, you will find a **detailed explanation**\\\\nabout different square root properties, e.g., how to simplify square roots,\\\\nwith many various **examples** given. With this article, you will learn once\\\\nand for all how to find square roots!\\\\n\\\\nHave you ever wondered what the origin of the square root symbol is √? We can\\\\nassure you that this history is not as simple as you might think at first. The\\\\norigin of the root symbol goes back to ancient times, as the origin of the\\\\npercent.\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\\\'re looking for the square root graph or square root function\\\\nproperties, head directly to the appropriate section (just click the links\\\\nabove!). There, we explain what the derivative of a square root using a\\\\nfundamental square root definition is; we also elaborate on how to calculate\\\\nthe square roots of exponents or square roots of fractions. Finally, if you\\\\nare persistent enough, you will find out that the square root of a negative\\\\nnumber is, in fact, possible. In that way, we introduce **complex numbers**\\\\nwhich find broad applications in physics and mathematics.\\\\n\\\\n## Square root symbol √\\\\n\\\\nThe operation of the square root of a number was already known in antiquity.\\\\nThe earliest clay tablet with the correct value of up to 5 decimal places of\\\\n√2 = 1.41421 comes from **Babylonia (1800 BCE - 1600 BCE)**. Many other\\\\ndocuments show that square roots were also used by the ancient Egyptians,\\\\nIndians, Greeks, and Chinese. However, the origin of the root symbol √ is\\\\nstill largely speculative.\\\\n\\\\n  * Many scholars believe that square roots originate from the **letter \"r\"** \\\\\\\\- the first letter of the Latin word radix meaning root.\\\\n  * Another theory states that the square root symbol was taken from the **Arabic letter ج** that was placed in its original form of ﺟ in the word جذر - root (the Arabic language is written from right to left).\\\\n\\\\nThe first use of the square root symbol √ didn\\\\\\'t include the horizontal \"bar\"\\\\nover the numbers inside the square root (or radical) symbol, √‾. The \"bar\" is\\\\nknown as a vinculum in Latin, meaning **bond**. Although the radical symbol\\\\nwith vinculum is now in everyday use, we usually omit this overline in many\\\\ntexts, like in articles on the internet. The notation of the higher degrees of\\\\na root has been suggested by Albert Girard, who placed the degree index within\\\\nthe opening of the radical sign, e.g., ³√ or ⁴√.\\\\n\\\\nThe last question is, why is the square root operation called root regardless\\\\nof its true origin? The explanation should become more evident if we write the\\\\nequation x = ⁿ√a in a different form: xⁿ = a. x is called a root or radical\\\\nbecause it is _the hidden base_ of a. Thus, the word _radical_ doesn\\\\\\'t mean\\\\n_far-reaching_ or _extreme_ , but instead **foundational, reaching the root\\\\ncause**.\\\\n\\\\n## Square root definition\\\\n\\\\nIn mathematics, the traditional operations on numbers are addition,\\\\nsubtraction, multiplication, and division. Nonetheless, we sometimes add to\\\\nthis list some more advanced operations and manipulations: **square roots** ,\\\\nexponents, logarithms, and even trigonometric functions (e.g., sine and\\\\ncosine). In this article, we will focus on the square root definition only.\\\\n\\\\nThe square root of a given number **x** is every number **y** whose square\\\\n**y² = y × y** yields the original number **x**. Therefore, the square root\\\\nformula can be expressed as:\\\\n\\\\n**√x = y ⟺ x = y²** ,\\\\n\\\\nwhere **⟺** is a mathematical symbol that means _if and only if_. Each\\\\npositive real number **always has two square roots** – the first is positive,\\\\nand the second is negative. However, for many practical purposes, we usually\\\\nuse the positive one. The only number that has one square root is zero. It is\\\\nbecause √0 = 0, and zero is neither positive nor negative.\\\\n\\\\nThere is also another common notation of square roots that could be more\\\\nconvenient in many complex calculations. This alternative square root formula\\\\nstates that the square root of a number is a number raised to the exponent of\\\\nthe fraction one-half:\\\\n\\\\n**√x = x(1/2) = x0.5**\\\\n\\\\nIn geometric interpretation, the square root of a given area of a square gives\\\\nthe length of its side. That\\\\\\'s why **√** has the word _square_ in its name. A\\\\nsimilar situation is with the cube root, **∛**. If you take the cube root of\\\\nthe volume of a cube, you get the length of its edges. While square roots are\\\\nused when considering surface areas, cube roots are useful to determine\\\\nquantities that relate to the volume, e.g., density.\\\\n\\\\n## How to find the square root?\\\\n\\\\nMaybe we aren\\\\\\'t being very modest, but we think that the best answer to the\\\\nquestion of how to find the square root is straightforward: **use the square\\\\nroot calculator!** You can use it both on your computer and your smartphone to\\\\nquickly estimate the square root of a given number. Unfortunately, there are\\\\nsometimes situations when you can rely only on yourself. What then? To prepare\\\\nfor this, you should remember several basic perfect square roots:\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 1: **√1 = 1** , since **1 × 1 = 1** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 4: **√4 = 2** , since **2 × 2 = 4** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 9: **√9 = 3** , since **3 × 3 = 9** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 16: **√16 = 4** , since **4 × 4 = 16** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 25: **√25 = 5** , since **5 × 5 = 25** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 36: **√36 = 6** , since **6 × 6 = 36** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 49: **√49 = 7** , since **7 × 7 = 49** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 64: **√64 = 8** , since **8 × 8 = 64** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 81: **√81 = 9** , since **9 × 9 = 81** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 100: **√100 = 10** , since **10 × 10 = 100** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 121: **√121 = 11** , since **11 × 11 = 121** ; and\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 144: **√144 = 12** , since **12 × 12 = 144**.\\\\n\\\\nThe above numbers are the simplest square roots because every time you obtain\\\\nan integer. Try to remember them! But what can you do when there is a number\\\\nthat doesn\\\\\\'t have such a nice square root? There are multiple solutions. First\\\\nof all, you can try to **predict the result by trial and error**. Let\\\\\\'s say\\\\nthat you want to estimate the square root of **52** :\\\\n\\\\n  1. You know that **√49 = 7** and **√64 = 8** , so **√52** should be between **7** and **8**.\\\\n\\\\n  2. Number **52** is closer to the **49** (effectively closer to the **7**), so you can try guessing that **√52** is **7.3**.\\\\n\\\\n  3. Then, you square **7.3** , obtaining **7.3² = 53.29** (as the square root formula says), which is higher than **52**. You have to try with a smaller number, let\\\\\\'s say **7.2**.\\\\n\\\\n  4. The square of **7.2** is **51.84**. Now you have a smaller number, but much closer to the **52**. If that accuracy satisfies you, you can end estimations here. Otherwise, you can repeat the procedure with a number chosen between **7.2** and **7.3** ,e.g., **7.22** , and so on and so forth.\\\\n\\\\nAnother approach is to **simplify the square root first and then use the\\\\napproximations of the prime numbers square roots** (typically rounded to two\\\\ndecimal places):\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 2: **√2 ≈ 1.41** ,\\\\n  * Square root of 3: **√3 ≈ 1.73** ,\\\\n  * Square root of 5: **√5 ≈ 2.24** ,\\\\n  * Square root of 7: **√7 ≈ 2.65** ,\\\\n  * Square root of 11: **√11 ≈ 3.32** ,\\\\n  * Square root of 13: **√13 ≈ 3.61** ,\\\\n  * Square root of 17: **√17 ≈ 4.12** ,\\\\n  * Square root of 19: **√19 ≈ 4.34** , etc.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s try and find the square root of **52** again. You can simplify it to\\\\n**√52 = 2√13** (you will learn how to simplify square root in the next\\\\nsection) and then substitute **√13 ≈ 3.61**. Finally, make a multiplication\\\\n**√52 ≈ 2 × 3.61 = 7.22**. The result is the same as before!\\\\n\\\\n## Square root calculator\\\\n\\\\nIn some situations, you don\\\\\\'t need to know the exact result of the square\\\\nroot. If this is the case, our square root calculator is the best option to\\\\nestimate the value of **every square root you desire**. For example, let\\\\\\'s say\\\\nyou want to know whether **4√5** is greater than **9**. From the calculator,\\\\nyou know that **√5 ≈ 2.23607** , so **4√5 ≈ 4 × 2.23607 = 8.94428**. It is\\\\nvery close to the **9** , but it isn\\\\\\'t greater than it! The square root\\\\ncalculator gives the final value with relatively high accuracy (to five digits\\\\nin the above example).\\\\n\\\\nRemember that our calculator automatically recalculates numbers entered into\\\\neither of the fields. You can find the square root of a specific number by\\\\nfilling the first window or getting the square of a number that you entered in\\\\nthe second window. The second option is handy in **finding perfect squares**\\\\nthat are essential in many aspects of math and science. For example, if you\\\\nenter **17** in the second field, you will find out that **289** is a perfect\\\\nsquare.\\\\n\\\\nIn some applications of the square root, particularly those pertaining to\\\\nsciences such as chemistry and physics, the results are preferred in\\\\nscientific notation. In brief, an answer in scientific notation must have a\\\\ndecimal point between the first two non-zero numbers. It will be represented\\\\nas the decimal multiplied by 10 raised to an exponent. For example, the number\\\\n**0.00345** is written as **3.45 × 10⁻³** in scientific notation, whereas\\\\n**145.67** is written as **1.4567 × 10²** in scientific notation. The results\\\\nobtained using the square root calculator can be converted to scientific\\\\nnotation with the scientific notation calculator.\\\\n\\\\n## How to simplify square roots\\\\n\\\\nFirst, let\\\\\\'s ask ourselves which square roots can be simplified. To answer it,\\\\nyou need to take the number which is after the square root symbol and find its\\\\nfactors. If any of its factors are square numbers (4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64\\\\nand so on), then you can simplify the square root. Why are these numbers\\\\nsquare? They can be respectively expressed as 2², 3², 4², 5², 6², 7² and so\\\\non. According to the square root definition, you can call them **perfect\\\\nsquares**. Let\\\\\\'s take a look at some examples:\\\\n\\\\n  * **Can you simplify √27?** The factors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, 27. There is 9 here! This means you can simplify √27.\\\\n\\\\n  * **Can you simplify √15?** Factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. There are no perfect squares in those numbers, so this square root can\\\\\\'t be simplified.\\\\n\\\\nSo, how to simplify square roots? To explain that, we will use a **handy\\\\nsquare root property** we have talked about earlier, namely, the alternative\\\\nsquare root formula:\\\\n\\\\n**√x = x(1/2)**\\\\n\\\\nWe can use those two forms of square roots and switch between them whenever we\\\\nwant. Particularly, we remember that power of multiplication of two specific\\\\nnumbers is equivalent to the multiplication of those specific numbers raised\\\\nto the same powers. Therefore, we can write:\\\\n\\\\n**(x × y)(1/2) = x(1/2) × y(1/2) ⟺ √(x × y) = √x × √y**,\\\\n\\\\nHow can you use this knowledge? The argument of a square root is usually not a\\\\nperfect square you can easily calculate, but it may **contain a perfect\\\\nsquare** among its factors. In other words, you can write it as a\\\\nmultiplication of two numbers, where one of the numbers is the perfect square,\\\\ne.g., **45 = 9 × 5** (9 is a perfect square). The requirement of having **at\\\\nleast one factor** that is a perfect square is necessary to simplify the\\\\nsquare root. At this point, you should probably know what the next step will\\\\nbe. You need to put this multiplication under the square root. In our example:\\\\n\\\\n**√45 = 45(1/2) = (9 × 5)(1/2) = 9(1/2) × 5(1/2) = √9 × √5 = 3√5**.\\\\n\\\\nYou have successfully simplified your first square root! Of course, you don\\\\\\'t\\\\nhave to write down all these calculations. As long as you remember that\\\\n**square root is equivalent to the power of one half** , you can shorten them.\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s practice simplifying square roots with some other examples:\\\\n\\\\n  * How to simplify the square root of 27?\\\\n\\\\n**√27 = √(9 × 3) = √9 × √3 = 3√3**\\\\n\\\\n  * How to simplify the square root of 8?\\\\n\\\\n**√8 = √(4 × 2) = √4 × √2 = 2√2**\\\\n\\\\n  * How to simplify the square root of 144?\\\\n\\\\n**√144 = √(4 × 36) = √4 × √36 = 2 × 6 = 12**\\\\n\\\\nIn the last example, you didn\\\\\\'t have to simplify the square root at all\\\\nbecause 144 is a perfect square. You could just remember that 12 × 12 = 144.\\\\nHowever, we wanted to show you that with the process of simplification, you\\\\ncan easily calculate the square roots of perfect squares too. It is useful\\\\nwhen **dealing with big numbers**.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, you may ask how to simplify roots of higher orders, e.g., cube roots.\\\\nIn fact, the process is very analogical to the square roots, but in the case\\\\nof cube roots, you have to find at least one factor that is a **perfect cube**\\\\n, not a perfect square, i.e., 8 = 2³, 27 = 3³, 64 = 4³, 125 = 5³ and so on.\\\\nThen you divide your number into two parts and put them under the cube root.\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s take the following example of simplifying ³√192:\\\\n\\\\n**∛192 = ∛(64 × 3) = ∛64 × ∛3 = 4∛3**\\\\n\\\\nIt may seem a little bit complicated at first glance, but after **some\\\\npractice** , you will be able to simplify the roots **in your head**. Trust\\\\nus!\\\\n\\\\n## Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing square roots\\\\n\\\\n**Adding square roots and subtracting square roots**\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, adding or subtracting square roots is not as easy as\\\\nadding/subtracting regular numbers. For example, if 2 + 3 = 5, it doesn\\\\\\'t mean\\\\nthat √2 + √3 equals √5. **That\\\\\\'s wrong!** To understand why that is, imagine\\\\nthat you have two different types of shapes: triangles 🔺 and circles 🔵. What\\\\nhappens when you add one triangle to one circle 🔺 + 🔵? Nothing! You still have\\\\none triangle and one circle 🔺 + 🔵. On the other hand, what happens when you\\\\ntry to add three triangles to five triangles: **3** 🔺 + **5** 🔺? You\\\\\\'ll end up\\\\nwith eight triangles **8** 🔺.\\\\n\\\\nAdding square roots is very similar to this. The result of adding √2 + √3 is\\\\nstill √2 + √3. You can\\\\\\'t simplify it further. It is a different situation,\\\\nhowever, when both square roots have **the same number under the root\\\\nsymbol**. Then we can add them just as regular numbers (or triangles). For\\\\nexample, 3√2 + 5√2 equals 8√2. The same thing is true for subtracting square\\\\nroots. Let\\\\\\'s take a look at more examples illustrating this square root\\\\nproperty:\\\\n\\\\n  * What is **6√17 + 5√17**? Answer: **6√17 + 5√17 = 11√17** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * What is **4√7 - 7√7**? Answer: **4√7 - 7√7 = -3√7** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * What is **2√2 + 3√8**? Answer: **2√2 + 3√8 = 2√2 + 6√2 = 8√2** , because we simplified √8 = √(4 × 2) = √4 × √2 = 2√2;\\\\n\\\\n  * What is **√45 - √20**? Answer: **√45 - √20 = 3√5 - 2√5 = √5** , because we simplified √45 = √(9 × 5) = √9 × √5 = 3√5 and √20 = √(4 × 5) = √4 × √5 = 2√5;\\\\n\\\\n  * What is **7√13 + 2√22**? Answer: **7√13 + 2√22** , we can\\\\\\'t simplify this further;\\\\n\\\\n  * What is **√3 - √18**? Answer: **√3 - √18 = √3 - 3√2** , we can\\\\\\'t simplify this further than this, but we at least simplified √18 = √(9 × 2) = √9 × √2 = 3√2.\\\\n\\\\n**Multiplying square roots and dividing square roots**\\\\n\\\\nNow, when adding square roots is a piece of cake for you, let\\\\\\'s go one step\\\\nfurther. What about multiplying square roots and dividing square roots? Don\\\\\\'t\\\\nbe scared! In fact, you already did it during the lesson on simplifying square\\\\nroots. Multiplying square roots is based on the square root property that we\\\\nhave used before a few times, that is:\\\\n\\\\n**√x = x(1/2)**\\\\n\\\\nDo you remember how to multiply numbers that are raised to the same power? As\\\\na reminder:\\\\n\\\\n**xⁿ × yⁿ = (x × y)ⁿ** ,\\\\n\\\\nand therefore\\\\n\\\\n**x(1/2) × y(1/2) = (x × y)(1/2) ⟺ √x × √y = √(x × y)**.\\\\n\\\\nAs opposed to addition, you can multiply **every** two square roots. Remember\\\\nthat multiplication **has commutative properties** , which means that the\\\\norder in which two numbers are multiplied does not matter. A few examples\\\\nshould clarify this issue:\\\\n\\\\n  * What is **√3 × √2**? Answer: **√3 × √2 = √6** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * What is **2√5 × 5√3**? Answer: **2√5 × 5√3 = 2 × 5 × √5 × √3 = 10√15** , because multiplication is commutative;\\\\n\\\\n  * What is **2√6 × 3√3**? Answer: **2√6 × 3√3 = 2 × 3 × √6 × √3 = 6√18 = 18√2** , we simplified √18 = √(9 × 2) = √9 × √2 = 3√2.\\\\n\\\\nDividing a square root is almost the same since:\\\\n\\\\n**x(1/2) / y(1/2) = (x / y)(1/2) ⟺ √x / √y = √(x / y)**.\\\\n\\\\nAll you need to do is to replace the multiplication sign with a division.\\\\nHowever, the **division is not a commutative operator**! You have to calculate\\\\nthe numbers that stand before the square roots and the numbers under the\\\\nsquare roots separately. As always, here are some practical examples:\\\\n\\\\n  * What is **√15 / √3**? Answer: **√15 / √3 = √5** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * What is **10√6 / 5√2**? Answer: **10√6 / 5√2 = (10 / 5) × (√6 / √2) = 2√3** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * What is **6√2 / 3√5**? Answer: **6√2 / 3√5 = (6 / 3) × (√2 / √5) = 2√(2/5) = 2√(0.4)** , we switched there from a simple fraction 2/5 to the decimal fraction 2/5 = 4/10 = 0.4.\\\\n\\\\n## Square roots of powers and fractions\\\\n\\\\nCalculating the square root of numbers elevated to a power or the square root\\\\nof fractions might not be clear to you. But with the knowledge you **acquired\\\\nin the previous section** , you should find it easier than you expected! Let\\\\\\'s\\\\nbegin with the square roots of powers. In that case, it will be easier for you\\\\nto use the alternative form of square root **√x = x(1/2)**. Do you remember\\\\nthe **power rule**? If not, here is a quick reminder:\\\\n\\\\n**(x n)m = x(n × m)**\\\\n\\\\nwhere **n** and **m** are any real numbers. Now, when you place **1/2**\\\\ninstead of **m** , you\\\\\\'ll get nothing else but a fraction as the exponent:\\\\n\\\\n**√(x n) = (xn)(1/2) = x(n/2)**\\\\n\\\\nAnd that\\\\\\'s how you find the square root of a number elevated to a power.\\\\nSpeaking of powers, the above equation looks very similar to the standard\\\\nnormal distribution density function, which is widely used in statistics.\\\\n\\\\nIf you\\\\\\'re still not sure about taking square roots of powers, here are a few\\\\nexamples:\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 24:\\\\n\\\\n**√(2 4) = (24)(1/2) = 2(4/2) = 22 = 4**\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 53:\\\\n\\\\n**√(5 3) = (53)(1/2) = 5(3/2)**\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 45:\\\\n\\\\n**√(4 5) = (45)(1/2) = 4(5/2) = (22)(5/2) = 25 = 32**\\\\n\\\\nAs you can see, sometimes it is impossible to get a pretty result like the\\\\nfirst example. However, in the third example, we showed you a little trick\\\\nwith expressing **4** as **2 2**. This approach can often simplify more\\\\ncomplicated equations.\\\\n\\\\nWhat about square roots of fractions? Take a look at the previous section\\\\nwhere we wrote about dividing square roots. You can find there the following\\\\nrelation that should explain everything:\\\\n\\\\n**(x / y)(1/2) ⟺ √x / √y = √(x / y)**\\\\n\\\\nwhere **x / y** is a fraction. Below, you can find some examples of square\\\\nroots of a fraction:\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 4/9:\\\\n\\\\n**√(4/9) = √4 / √9 = 2/3**\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 1/100:\\\\n\\\\n**√(1/100) = √1 / √100 = 1/10**\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of 1/5:\\\\n\\\\n**√(1/5) = √1 / √5 = 1/√5 = √5/5**\\\\n\\\\nLeaving roots in the denominator is not a very good habit. That\\\\\\'s why we got\\\\nrid of it in the last example. We just multiplied both the numerator and\\\\ndenominator by the same number (we can always do that, as the number we\\\\nmultiply by equals 1), in this case, by **√5**.\\\\n\\\\n## Square root function and graph\\\\n\\\\nFunctions play a vital role not only in mathematics but in many other areas\\\\nlike physics, statistics, or finance. Function **f(x)** is nothing more than a\\\\nformula that says how the value of **f(x)** changes with the argument **x**.\\\\nYou will find there some functions that you can apply in real life. They\\\\\\'re a\\\\ngreat help if you want to know how to calculate compound interest or estimate\\\\nthe future value of an annuity.\\\\n\\\\nBelow you can find the square root graph, made up of **half of a parabola**.\\\\nCheck it and try to validate, for example, whether the square root function of\\\\n**x = 9** is **3** and of **x = 16** is **4** (as it should be).\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s go back to the square root function **f(x) = √x** and explore what are\\\\nits **basic properties**. We consider there only the positive part of `f(x)`\\\\n(as you can see in the square root graph above). So, the square root function:\\\\n\\\\n  * Is **continuous and growing** for all non-negative **x** ;\\\\n\\\\n  * Is **differentiable** for all positive **x** (see the derivative of the square root section for more information);\\\\n\\\\n  * **Approaches the limit of infinity** as **x** approaches infinity (**lim √x → ∞** when **x → ∞**); and\\\\n\\\\n  * Is a **real number** for all non-negative **x** and a **complex number** for all negative **x**.\\\\n\\\\n## Derivative of the square root\\\\n\\\\nA derivative of a function tells us how fast this function changes with its\\\\nargument. One of the simplest examples in physics is the position of an object\\\\nand its velocity (the rate of change of position). Let\\\\\\'s say that the function\\\\n**x(t)** describes how the distance of the moving car from a specific point\\\\nchanges with time **t**. Do you know what determines how fast the change is in\\\\nyour distance traveled? The answer is the speed of the car! So the derivative\\\\nof the position **x(t)** is velocity **v(t)**(velocity can depend on time\\\\ntoo). To denote the derivative, we usually use the apostrophe **v(t) = x\\\\\\'(t)**\\\\nor the derivative symbol **v(t) = dx(t)/dt**.\\\\n\\\\nThe derivative of the general function **f(x)** is not always easy to\\\\ncalculate. However, in some circumstances, if the function takes a specific\\\\nform, we\\\\\\'ve got some formulas. For example, if\\\\n\\\\n**f(x) = x n**,\\\\n\\\\nwhere **n** is any real number, the derivative is as follows:\\\\n\\\\n**f\\\\\\'(x) = n × x(n-1)**.\\\\n\\\\nIt may not look like it, but this answers the question **what is the\\\\nderivative of a square root**. Do you remember the alternative (exponential)\\\\nform of a square root? Let us remind you:\\\\n\\\\n**√x = x(1/2)**.\\\\n\\\\nYou can see that in this case, **n = 1/2** , so the derivative of a square\\\\nroot is:\\\\n\\\\n**(√x)\\\\\\' = (x(1/2))\\\\\\' = 1/2 × x(-1/2) = 1/(2√x)**.\\\\n\\\\nSince a number to a negative power is one over that number, the estimation of\\\\nthe derivation will involve fractions. We\\\\\\'ve got a tool that could be\\\\nessential when adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators. It\\\\nis called the LCM calculator, and it tells you how to find the Least Common\\\\nMultiple.\\\\n\\\\nThe derivative of a square root is needed to obtain the coefficients in the\\\\nso-called **Taylor expansion**. We don\\\\\\'t want to dive into details too deeply,\\\\nso briefly, the Taylor series allows you to **approximate various functions**\\\\nwith the polynomials that are much easier to calculate. For example, the\\\\nTaylor expansion of **√(1 + x)** about the point **x = 0** is given by:\\\\n\\\\n**√(1 + x) = 1 + 1/2 × x - 1/8 × x² + 1/16 × x³ - 5/128 × x⁴ + ...** ,\\\\n\\\\nwhich is valid for **-1 ≤ x ≤ 1**. Although the above expression has an\\\\ninfinite number of terms, to get the approximate value, you can use just a few\\\\nfirst terms. Let\\\\\\'s try it! With **x = 0.5** and the first five terms, you get:\\\\n\\\\n**√(1.5) = 1 + 1/2 × 0.5 - 1/8 × 0.25 + 1/16 × 0.125 - 5/128 × 0.0625** ,\\\\n\\\\n**√(1.5) ≈ 1.2241** ,\\\\n\\\\nand the real value, provided by our calculator, is **√(1.5) ≈ 1.2247**. Close\\\\nenough!\\\\n\\\\nThat was a lot of maths and equations so far. For those of you who are\\\\npersistent enough, we\\\\\\'ve prepared the next section, which explains how to\\\\ncalculate the square root of a negative number.\\\\n\\\\n## Square root of a negative number\\\\n\\\\nAt school, you probably have been taught that the square root of a negative\\\\nnumber does not exist. This is true when you consider only real numbers. A\\\\nlong time ago, to perform advanced calculations, mathematicians had to\\\\nintroduce a more general set of numbers – the **complex numbers**. They can be\\\\nexpressed in the following form:\\\\n\\\\n**x = a + b × i** ,\\\\n\\\\nwhere **x** is the complex number with the real part **a** and the imaginary\\\\npart **b**. What differs between a complex number and a real one is the\\\\nimaginary number **i**. Here you have some examples of complex numbers: **2 +\\\\n3i** , **5i** , **1.5 + 4i** , and **2**. You may be surprised to see **2**\\\\nthere, which is a real number. Yes, it is, but it is also a complex number\\\\nwith **b = 0**. **Complex numbers are a generalization of real numbers.**\\\\n\\\\nSo far, the imaginary number **i** is probably still a mystery for you. What\\\\nis it at all? Well, although it may look weird, it is defined by the following\\\\nequation:\\\\n\\\\n**i = √(-1)** ,\\\\n\\\\nand that\\\\\\'s all that you need to calculate the square root of every number,\\\\nwhether it is positive or not. Let\\\\\\'s see some examples:\\\\n\\\\n  * Square root of -9: **√(-9) = √(-1 × 9) = √(-1)√9 = 3i** ;\\\\n  * Square root of -13: **√(-13) = √(-1 × 13) = √(-1)√13 = i√13** ; and\\\\n  * Square root of -49: **√(-49) = √(-1 × 49) = √(-1)√49 = 7i**.\\\\n\\\\nIsn\\\\\\'t that simple? This problem doesn\\\\\\'t arise with the cube root since you can\\\\nobtain the negative number by multiplying three of the identical negative\\\\nnumbers (which you can\\\\\\'t do with two negative numbers). For example:\\\\n\\\\n**³√(-64) = ³√[(-4)×(-4)×(-4)] = -4**.\\\\n\\\\nAnd that\\\\\\'s all you need to know about square roots!\\\\n\\\\nFAQs\\\\n\\\\n### Can a number have more than one square root?\\\\n\\\\nYes, in fact, **all positive numbers have 2 square roots** , one that is\\\\npositive and another that is equal but negative to the first. This is because\\\\nif you multiply two negatives together, the negatives cancel, and the result\\\\nis positive.\\\\n\\\\n### How do you find the square root without a calculator?\\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\\\'s how to find the square root of a number without a calculator:\\\\n\\\\n  1. **Make an estimate** of the square root. The closest square number is acceptable if you’re at a loss.\\\\n\\\\n  2. Divide the number you want to find the square root of by the estimate.\\\\n\\\\n  3. Add the estimate to the result of step 2.\\\\n\\\\n  4. Divide the result of step 3 by 2. **This is your new estimate**.\\\\n\\\\n  5. Repeat steps 2-4 with your new estimate. The more times this is repeated, the more accurate the result is.\\\\n\\\\n### How can I estimate square roots?\\\\n\\\\nTo estimate the square root of a number:\\\\n\\\\n  1. Find the **nearest square number above and below** the number you are thinking of.\\\\n\\\\n  2. The square root will be **between** the square roots of these numbers.\\\\n\\\\n  3. The **closeness** of the number to a square root indicates how close the root is. For example, 26 is very close to 25, so the root will be very close to 5.\\\\n\\\\n  4. **Try a few times to get the hang of it**.\\\\n\\\\n### Is the square root of 2 a rational number?\\\\n\\\\nNo, **the square root of 2 is not rational**. This is because when 2 is\\\\nwritten as a fraction, 2/1, it can never have only even exponents, and\\\\ntherefore a rational number cannot have been squared to create it.\\\\n\\\\n### How can I get rid of a square root?\\\\n\\\\nIn algebra, **squaring both sides of the equation will get rid of any square\\\\nroots**. The result of this operation is that the square roots will be\\\\nreplaced with whatever number they were finding the square root of.\\\\n\\\\n### Are square roots rational?\\\\n\\\\n**Some square roots are rational** , whereas others are not. You can work out\\\\nif a square root is rational or not by finding out if the number you are\\\\nsquare rooting can be expressed in terms of only even exponents (e.g., 4 = 22\\\\n/ 12). If it can, its root is rational.\\\\n\\\\n### Is the square root of 5 a rational number?\\\\n\\\\nThe square root of 5 is not a rational number. This is because 5 cannot be\\\\nexpressed as a fraction where both the numerator and denominator have even\\\\nexponents. This means that a rational number cannot have been squared to get\\\\n5.\\\\n\\\\n### Is the square root of 7 a rational number?\\\\n\\\\nThe result of square rooting 7 is an irrational number. 7 cannot be written as\\\\na fraction with only even exponents, meaning that the number squared to reach\\\\n7 cannot be expressed as a fraction of integers and therefore is not rational.\\\\n\\\\n### What is the derivative of the square root of x?\\\\n\\\\nThe derivative of square root x is x-1/2 / 2, or 1/(2√x). This is because the\\\\nsquare root of x can be expressed as x1/2, from which differentiation occurs\\\\nnormally.\\\\n\\\\n### How do you find the square root of a decimal?\\\\n\\\\nTo find the square root of a decimal:\\\\n\\\\n  1. Convert the **decimal into a fraction**.\\\\n\\\\n  2. **Find** any square roots of the fraction or estimate it. **Make** the fraction equal to the square root you found squared.\\\\n\\\\n  3. **Cancel the square root** and the square leaving you with the fraction.\\\\n\\\\n  4. **Rewrite** the fraction as a decimal as your final answer.\\\\n\\\\nRelated calculators\\\\n\\\\nLeast Common Multiple CalculatorAbsolute Value Calculator\\\\n\\\\nNumber\\\\n\\\\nSquare root\\\\n\\\\nShare result\\\\n\\\\nReload calculator\\\\n\\\\nCheck out 75 similar arithmetic calculators ➗\\\\n\\\\nAbsolute changeAbsolute valueAdding and subtracting fractions...72 more\\\\n\\\\nCalculator categories\\\\n\\\\n  * Biology\\\\n  * Chemistry\\\\n  * Construction\\\\n  * Conversion\\\\n  * Ecology\\\\n  * Everyday life\\\\n  * Finance\\\\n  * Food\\\\n  * Health\\\\n  * Math\\\\n  * Physics\\\\n  * Sports\\\\n  * Statistics\\\\n  * Other\\\\n  * Discover Omni\\\\n\\\\nPress\\\\n\\\\n  * Editorial policies\\\\n  * Journalist\\\\\\'s Guide to Numbers\\\\n  * Partnerships\\\\n\\\\nMeet Omni\\\\n\\\\n  * About\\\\n  * Blog\\\\n  * Contact\\\\n  * We\\\\\\'re hiring!\\\\n\\\\nOmni Calculator on FacebookOmni Calculator on YouTubeOmni Calculator on\\\\nTwitterOmni Calculator on LinkedInOmni Calculator on Instagram\\\\n\\\\nEnglish\\\\n\\\\n  * English\\\\n\\\\n  * Spanish (Español)\\\\n  * German (Deutsch)\\\\n  * French (Français)\\\\n  * Portuguese (Português)\\\\n  * Italian (Italiano)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\u200b\\\\n\\\\nPrivacy, Cookies & Terms of ServiceCopyright by Omni Calculator sp. z o.o.\\\\n\\\\n\\')] </documenet>']\n",

Just enter the chosen number and read the results. Everything is\\\\\\\\ncalculated **quickly and automatically**! With this tool, you can also\\\\\\\\nestimate the square of the desired number (just enter the value into the\\\\\\\\nsecond field), which may be a great help in finding **perfect squares** from\\\\\\\\nthe square root formula.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAre you struggling with the basic arithmetic operations: adding square roots,\\\\\\\\nsubtracting square roots, multiplying square roots, or dividing square roots?\\\\\\\\nNot anymore! In the following text, you will find a **detailed explanation**\\\\\\\\nabout different square root properties, e.g., how to simplify square roots,\\\\\\\\nwith many various **examples** given. With this article, you will learn once\\\\\\\\nand for all how to find square roots!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHave you ever wondered what the origin of the square root symbol is √? We can\\\\\\\\nassure you that this history is not as simple as you might think at first. The\\\\\\\\norigin of the root symbol goes back to ancient times, as the origin of the\\\\\\\\npercent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\\\\\\\'re looking for the square root graph or square root function\\\\\\\\nproperties, head directly to the appropriate section (just click the links\\\\\\\\nabove!). There, we explain what the derivative of a square root using a\\\\\\\\nfundamental square root definition is; we also elaborate on how to calculate\\\\\\\\nthe square roots of exponents or square roots of fractions. Finally, if you\\\\\\\\nare persistent enough, you will find out that the square root of a negative\\\\\\\\nnumber is, in fact, possible. In that way, we introduce **complex numbers**\\\\\\\\nwhich find broad applications in physics and mathematics.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Square root symbol √\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe operation of the square root of a number was already known in antiquity.\\\\\\\\nThe earliest clay tablet with the correct value of up to 5 decimal places of\\\\\\\\n√2 = 1.41421 comes from **Babylonia (1800 BCE - 1600 BCE)**. Many other\\\\\\\\ndocuments show that square roots were also used by the ancient Egyptians,\\\\\\\\nIndians, Greeks, and Chinese. However, the origin of the root symbol √ is\\\\\\\\nstill largely speculative.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Many scholars believe that square roots originate from the **letter \\\\\"r\\\\\"** \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\- the first letter of the Latin word radix meaning root.\\\\\\\\n  * Another theory states that the square root symbol was taken from the **Arabic letter ج** that was placed in its original form of ﺟ in the word جذر - root (the Arabic language is written from right to left).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first use of the square root symbol √ didn\\\\\\\\\\'t include the horizontal \\\\\"bar\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nover the numbers inside the square root (or radical) symbol, √‾. The \\\\\"bar\\\\\" is\\\\\\\\nknown as a vinculum in Latin, meaning **bond**. Although the radical symbol\\\\\\\\nwith vinculum is now in everyday use, we usually omit this overline in many\\\\\\\\ntexts, like in articles on the internet. The notation of the higher degrees of\\\\\\\\na root has been suggested by Albert Girard, who placed the degree index within\\\\\\\\nthe opening of the radical sign, e.g., ³√ or ⁴√.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe last question is, why is the square root operation called root regardless\\\\\\\\nof its true origin? The explanation should become more evident if we write the\\\\\\\\nequation x = ⁿ√a in a different form: xⁿ = a. x is called a root or radical\\\\\\\\nbecause it is _the hidden base_ of a. Thus, the word _radical_ doesn\\\\\\\\\\'t mean\\\\\\\\n_far-reaching_ or _extreme_ , but instead **foundational, reaching the root\\\\\\\\ncause**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Square root definition\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn mathematics, the traditional operations on numbers are addition,\\\\\\\\nsubtraction, multiplication, and division. Nonetheless, we sometimes add to\\\\\\\\nthis list some more advanced operations and manipulations: **square roots** ,\\\\\\\\nexponents, logarithms, and even trigonometric functions (e.g., sine and\\\\\\\\ncosine). In this article, we will focus on the square root definition only.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe square root of a given number **x** is every number **y** whose square\\\\\\\\n**y² = y × y** yields the original number **x**. Therefore, the square root\\\\\\\\nformula can be expressed as:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√x = y ⟺ x = y²** ,\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nwhere **⟺** is a mathematical symbol that means _if and only if_. Each\\\\\\\\npositive real number **always has two square roots** – the first is positive,\\\\\\\\nand the second is negative. However, for many practical purposes, we usually\\\\\\\\nuse the positive one. The only number that has one square root is zero. It is\\\\\\\\nbecause √0 = 0, and zero is neither positive nor negative.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThere is also another common notation of square roots that could be more\\\\\\\\nconvenient in many complex calculations. This alternative square root formula\\\\\\\\nstates that the square root of a number is a number raised to the exponent of\\\\\\\\nthe fraction one-half:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√x = x(1/2) = x0.5**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn geometric interpretation, the square root of a given area of a square gives\\\\\\\\nthe length of its side. That\\\\\\\\\\'s why **√** has the word _square_ in its name. A\\\\\\\\nsimilar situation is with the cube root, **∛**. If you take the cube root of\\\\\\\\nthe volume of a cube, you get the length of its edges. While square roots are\\\\\\\\nused when considering surface areas, cube roots are useful to determine\\\\\\\\nquantities that relate to the volume, e.g., density.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## How to find the square root?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMaybe we aren\\\\\\\\\\'t being very modest, but we think that the best answer to the\\\\\\\\nquestion of how to find the square root is straightforward: **use the square\\\\\\\\nroot calculator!** You can use it both on your computer and your smartphone to\\\\\\\\nquickly estimate the square root of a given number. Unfortunately, there are\\\\\\\\nsometimes situations when you can rely only on yourself. What then? To prepare\\\\\\\\nfor this, you should remember several basic perfect square roots:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 1: **√1 = 1** , since **1 × 1 = 1** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 4: **√4 = 2** , since **2 × 2 = 4** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 9: **√9 = 3** , since **3 × 3 = 9** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 16: **√16 = 4** , since **4 × 4 = 16** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 25: **√25 = 5** , since **5 × 5 = 25** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 36: **√36 = 6** , since **6 × 6 = 36** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 49: **√49 = 7** , since **7 × 7 = 49** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 64: **√64 = 8** , since **8 × 8 = 64** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 81: **√81 = 9** , since **9 × 9 = 81** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 100: **√100 = 10** , since **10 × 10 = 100** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 121: **√121 = 11** , since **11 × 11 = 121** ; and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 144: **√144 = 12** , since **12 × 12 = 144**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe above numbers are the simplest square roots because every time you obtain\\\\\\\\nan integer. Try to remember them! But what can you do when there is a number\\\\\\\\nthat doesn\\\\\\\\\\'t have such a nice square root? There are multiple solutions. First\\\\\\\\nof all, you can try to **predict the result by trial and error**. Let\\\\\\\\\\'s say\\\\\\\\nthat you want to estimate the square root of **52** :\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  1. You know that **√49 = 7** and **√64 = 8** , so **√52** should be between **7** and **8**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  2. Number **52** is closer to the **49** (effectively closer to the **7**), so you can try guessing that **√52** is **7.3**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  3. Then, you square **7.3** , obtaining **7.3² = 53.29** (as the square root formula says), which is higher than **52**. You have to try with a smaller number, let\\\\\\\\\\'s say **7.2**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  4. The square of **7.2** is **51.84**. Now you have a smaller number, but much closer to the **52**. If that accuracy satisfies you, you can end estimations here. Otherwise, you can repeat the procedure with a number chosen between **7.2** and **7.3** ,e.g., **7.22** , and so on and so forth.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnother approach is to **simplify the square root first and then use the\\\\\\\\napproximations of the prime numbers square roots** (typically rounded to two\\\\\\\\ndecimal places):\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 2: **√2 ≈ 1.41** ,\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 3: **√3 ≈ 1.73** ,\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 5: **√5 ≈ 2.24** ,\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 7: **√7 ≈ 2.65** ,\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 11: **√11 ≈ 3.32** ,\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 13: **√13 ≈ 3.61** ,\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 17: **√17 ≈ 4.12** ,\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 19: **√19 ≈ 4.34** , etc.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\\\\\\\'s try and find the square root of **52** again. You can simplify it to\\\\\\\\n**√52 = 2√13** (you will learn how to simplify square root in the next\\\\\\\\nsection) and then substitute **√13 ≈ 3.61**. Finally, make a multiplication\\\\\\\\n**√52 ≈ 2 × 3.61 = 7.22**. The result is the same as before!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Square root calculator\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn some situations, you don\\\\\\\\\\'t need to know the exact result of the square\\\\\\\\nroot. If this is the case, our square root calculator is the best option to\\\\\\\\nestimate the value of **every square root you desire**. For example, let\\\\\\\\\\'s say\\\\\\\\nyou want to know whether **4√5** is greater than **9**. From the calculator,\\\\\\\\nyou know that **√5 ≈ 2.23607** , so **4√5 ≈ 4 × 2.23607 = 8.94428**. It is\\\\\\\\nvery close to the **9** , but it isn\\\\\\\\\\'t greater than it! The square root\\\\\\\\ncalculator gives the final value with relatively high accuracy (to five digits\\\\\\\\nin the above example).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRemember that our calculator automatically recalculates numbers entered into\\\\\\\\neither of the fields. You can find the square root of a specific number by\\\\\\\\nfilling the first window or getting the square of a number that you entered in\\\\\\\\nthe second window. The second option is handy in **finding perfect squares**\\\\\\\\nthat are essential in many aspects of math and science. For example, if you\\\\\\\\nenter **17** in the second field, you will find out that **289** is a perfect\\\\\\\\nsquare.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn some applications of the square root, particularly those pertaining to\\\\\\\\nsciences such as chemistry and physics, the results are preferred in\\\\\\\\nscientific notation. In brief, an answer in scientific notation must have a\\\\\\\\ndecimal point between the first two non-zero numbers. It will be represented\\\\\\\\nas the decimal multiplied by 10 raised to an exponent. For example, the number\\\\\\\\n**0.00345** is written as **3.45 × 10⁻³** in scientific notation, whereas\\\\\\\\n**145.67** is written as **1.4567 × 10²** in scientific notation. The results\\\\\\\\nobtained using the square root calculator can be converted to scientific\\\\\\\\nnotation with the scientific notation calculator.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## How to simplify square roots\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, let\\\\\\\\\\'s ask ourselves which square roots can be simplified. To answer it,\\\\\\\\nyou need to take the number which is after the square root symbol and find its\\\\\\\\nfactors. If any of its factors are square numbers (4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64\\\\\\\\nand so on), then you can simplify the square root. Why are these numbers\\\\\\\\nsquare? They can be respectively expressed as 2², 3², 4², 5², 6², 7² and so\\\\\\\\non. According to the square root definition, you can call them **perfect\\\\\\\\nsquares**. Let\\\\\\\\\\'s take a look at some examples:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * **Can you simplify √27?** The factors of 27 are 1, 3, 9, 27. There is 9 here! This means you can simplify √27.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * **Can you simplify √15?** Factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. There are no perfect squares in those numbers, so this square root can\\\\\\\\\\'t be simplified.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, how to simplify square roots? To explain that, we will use a **handy\\\\\\\\nsquare root property** we have talked about earlier, namely, the alternative\\\\\\\\nsquare root formula:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√x = x(1/2)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWe can use those two forms of square roots and switch between them whenever we\\\\\\\\nwant. Particularly, we remember that power of multiplication of two specific\\\\\\\\nnumbers is equivalent to the multiplication of those specific numbers raised\\\\\\\\nto the same powers. Therefore, we can write:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**(x × y)(1/2) = x(1/2) × y(1/2) ⟺ √(x × y) = √x × √y**,\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHow can you use this knowledge? The argument of a square root is usually not a\\\\\\\\nperfect square you can easily calculate, but it may **contain a perfect\\\\\\\\nsquare** among its factors. In other words, you can write it as a\\\\\\\\nmultiplication of two numbers, where one of the numbers is the perfect square,\\\\\\\\ne.g., **45 = 9 × 5** (9 is a perfect square). The requirement of having **at\\\\\\\\nleast one factor** that is a perfect square is necessary to simplify the\\\\\\\\nsquare root. At this point, you should probably know what the next step will\\\\\\\\nbe. You need to put this multiplication under the square root. In our example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√45 = 45(1/2) = (9 × 5)(1/2) = 9(1/2) × 5(1/2) = √9 × √5 = 3√5**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou have successfully simplified your first square root! Of course, you don\\\\\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\nhave to write down all these calculations. As long as you remember that\\\\\\\\n**square root is equivalent to the power of one half** , you can shorten them.\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\\\\\\\'s practice simplifying square roots with some other examples:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * How to simplify the square root of 27?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√27 = √(9 × 3) = √9 × √3 = 3√3**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * How to simplify the square root of 8?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√8 = √(4 × 2) = √4 × √2 = 2√2**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * How to simplify the square root of 144?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√144 = √(4 × 36) = √4 × √36 = 2 × 6 = 12**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn the last example, you didn\\\\\\\\\\'t have to simplify the square root at all\\\\\\\\nbecause 144 is a perfect square. You could just remember that 12 × 12 = 144.\\\\\\\\nHowever, we wanted to show you that with the process of simplification, you\\\\\\\\ncan easily calculate the square roots of perfect squares too. It is useful\\\\\\\\nwhen **dealing with big numbers**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, you may ask how to simplify roots of higher orders, e.g., cube roots.\\\\\\\\nIn fact, the process is very analogical to the square roots, but in the case\\\\\\\\nof cube roots, you have to find at least one factor that is a **perfect cube**\\\\\\\\n, not a perfect square, i.e., 8 = 2³, 27 = 3³, 64 = 4³, 125 = 5³ and so on.\\\\\\\\nThen you divide your number into two parts and put them under the cube root.\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\\\\\\\'s take the following example of simplifying ³√192:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**∛192 = ∛(64 × 3) = ∛64 × ∛3 = 4∛3**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt may seem a little bit complicated at first glance, but after **some\\\\\\\\npractice** , you will be able to simplify the roots **in your head**. Trust\\\\\\\\nus!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing square roots\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Adding square roots and subtracting square roots**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, adding or subtracting square roots is not as easy as\\\\\\\\nadding/subtracting regular numbers. For example, if 2 + 3 = 5, it doesn\\\\\\\\\\'t mean\\\\\\\\nthat √2 + √3 equals √5. **That\\\\\\\\\\'s wrong!** To understand why that is, imagine\\\\\\\\nthat you have two different types of shapes: triangles 🔺 and circles 🔵. What\\\\\\\\nhappens when you add one triangle to one circle 🔺 + 🔵? Nothing! You still have\\\\\\\\none triangle and one circle 🔺 + 🔵. On the other hand, what happens when you\\\\\\\\ntry to add three triangles to five triangles: **3** 🔺 + **5** 🔺? You\\\\\\\\\\'ll end up\\\\\\\\nwith eight triangles **8** 🔺.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAdding square roots is very similar to this. The result of adding √2 + √3 is\\\\\\\\nstill √2 + √3. You can\\\\\\\\\\'t simplify it further. It is a different situation,\\\\\\\\nhowever, when both square roots have **the same number under the root\\\\\\\\nsymbol**. Then we can add them just as regular numbers (or triangles). For\\\\\\\\nexample, 3√2 + 5√2 equals 8√2. The same thing is true for subtracting square\\\\\\\\nroots. Let\\\\\\\\\\'s take a look at more examples illustrating this square root\\\\\\\\nproperty:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * What is **6√17 + 5√17**? Answer: **6√17 + 5√17 = 11√17** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * What is **4√7 - 7√7**? Answer: **4√7 - 7√7 = -3√7** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * What is **2√2 + 3√8**? Answer: **2√2 + 3√8 = 2√2 + 6√2 = 8√2** , because we simplified √8 = √(4 × 2) = √4 × √2 = 2√2;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * What is **√45 - √20**? Answer: **√45 - √20 = 3√5 - 2√5 = √5** , because we simplified √45 = √(9 × 5) = √9 × √5 = 3√5 and √20 = √(4 × 5) = √4 × √5 = 2√5;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * What is **7√13 + 2√22**? Answer: **7√13 + 2√22** , we can\\\\\\\\\\'t simplify this further;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * What is **√3 - √18**? Answer: **√3 - √18 = √3 - 3√2** , we can\\\\\\\\\\'t simplify this further than this, but we at least simplified √18 = √(9 × 2) = √9 × √2 = 3√2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Multiplying square roots and dividing square roots**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, when adding square roots is a piece of cake for you, let\\\\\\\\\\'s go one step\\\\\\\\nfurther. What about multiplying square roots and dividing square roots? Don\\\\\\\\\\'t\\\\\\\\nbe scared! In fact, you already did it during the lesson on simplifying square\\\\\\\\nroots. Multiplying square roots is based on the square root property that we\\\\\\\\nhave used before a few times, that is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√x = x(1/2)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDo you remember how to multiply numbers that are raised to the same power? As\\\\\\\\na reminder:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**xⁿ × yⁿ = (x × y)ⁿ** ,\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nand therefore\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**x(1/2) × y(1/2) = (x × y)(1/2) ⟺ √x × √y = √(x × y)**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs opposed to addition, you can multiply **every** two square roots. Remember\\\\\\\\nthat multiplication **has commutative properties** , which means that the\\\\\\\\norder in which two numbers are multiplied does not matter. A few examples\\\\\\\\nshould clarify this issue:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * What is **√3 × √2**? Answer: **√3 × √2 = √6** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * What is **2√5 × 5√3**? Answer: **2√5 × 5√3 = 2 × 5 × √5 × √3 = 10√15** , because multiplication is commutative;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * What is **2√6 × 3√3**? Answer: **2√6 × 3√3 = 2 × 3 × √6 × √3 = 6√18 = 18√2** , we simplified √18 = √(9 × 2) = √9 × √2 = 3√2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDividing a square root is almost the same since:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**x(1/2) / y(1/2) = (x / y)(1/2) ⟺ √x / √y = √(x / y)**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll you need to do is to replace the multiplication sign with a division.\\\\\\\\nHowever, the **division is not a commutative operator**! You have to calculate\\\\\\\\nthe numbers that stand before the square roots and the numbers under the\\\\\\\\nsquare roots separately. As always, here are some practical examples:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * What is **√15 / √3**? Answer: **√15 / √3 = √5** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * What is **10√6 / 5√2**? Answer: **10√6 / 5√2 = (10 / 5) × (√6 / √2) = 2√3** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * What is **6√2 / 3√5**? Answer: **6√2 / 3√5 = (6 / 3) × (√2 / √5) = 2√(2/5) = 2√(0.4)** , we switched there from a simple fraction 2/5 to the decimal fraction 2/5 = 4/10 = 0.4.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Square roots of powers and fractions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCalculating the square root of numbers elevated to a power or the square root\\\\\\\\nof fractions might not be clear to you. But with the knowledge you **acquired\\\\\\\\nin the previous section** , you should find it easier than you expected! Let\\\\\\\\\\'s\\\\\\\\nbegin with the square roots of powers. In that case, it will be easier for you\\\\\\\\nto use the alternative form of square root **√x = x(1/2)**. Do you remember\\\\\\\\nthe **power rule**? If not, here is a quick reminder:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**(x n)m = x(n × m)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nwhere **n** and **m** are any real numbers. Now, when you place **1/2**\\\\\\\\ninstead of **m** , you\\\\\\\\\\'ll get nothing else but a fraction as the exponent:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√(x n) = (xn)(1/2) = x(n/2)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd that\\\\\\\\\\'s how you find the square root of a number elevated to a power.\\\\\\\\nSpeaking of powers, the above equation looks very similar to the standard\\\\\\\\nnormal distribution density function, which is widely used in statistics.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIf you\\\\\\\\\\'re still not sure about taking square roots of powers, here are a few\\\\\\\\nexamples:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 24:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√(2 4) = (24)(1/2) = 2(4/2) = 22 = 4**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 53:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√(5 3) = (53)(1/2) = 5(3/2)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 45:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√(4 5) = (45)(1/2) = 4(5/2) = (22)(5/2) = 25 = 32**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAs you can see, sometimes it is impossible to get a pretty result like the\\\\\\\\nfirst example. However, in the third example, we showed you a little trick\\\\\\\\nwith expressing **4** as **2 2**. This approach can often simplify more\\\\\\\\ncomplicated equations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhat about square roots of fractions? Take a look at the previous section\\\\\\\\nwhere we wrote about dividing square roots. You can find there the following\\\\\\\\nrelation that should explain everything:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**(x / y)(1/2) ⟺ √x / √y = √(x / y)**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nwhere **x / y** is a fraction. Below, you can find some examples of square\\\\\\\\nroots of a fraction:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 4/9:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√(4/9) = √4 / √9 = 2/3**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 1/100:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√(1/100) = √1 / √100 = 1/10**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of 1/5:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√(1/5) = √1 / √5 = 1/√5 = √5/5**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLeaving roots in the denominator is not a very good habit. That\\\\\\\\\\'s why we got\\\\\\\\nrid of it in the last example. We just multiplied both the numerator and\\\\\\\\ndenominator by the same number (we can always do that, as the number we\\\\\\\\nmultiply by equals 1), in this case, by **√5**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Square root function and graph\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFunctions play a vital role not only in mathematics but in many other areas\\\\\\\\nlike physics, statistics, or finance. Function **f(x)** is nothing more than a\\\\\\\\nformula that says how the value of **f(x)** changes with the argument **x**.\\\\\\\\nYou will find there some functions that you can apply in real life. They\\\\\\\\\\'re a\\\\\\\\ngreat help if you want to know how to calculate compound interest or estimate\\\\\\\\nthe future value of an annuity.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBelow you can find the square root graph, made up of **half of a parabola**.\\\\\\\\nCheck it and try to validate, for example, whether the square root function of\\\\\\\\n**x = 9** is **3** and of **x = 16** is **4** (as it should be).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet\\\\\\\\\\'s go back to the square root function **f(x) = √x** and explore what are\\\\\\\\nits **basic properties**. We consider there only the positive part of `f(x)`\\\\\\\\n(as you can see in the square root graph above). So, the square root function:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Is **continuous and growing** for all non-negative **x** ;\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Is **differentiable** for all positive **x** (see the derivative of the square root section for more information);\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * **Approaches the limit of infinity** as **x** approaches infinity (**lim √x → ∞** when **x → ∞**); and\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Is a **real number** for all non-negative **x** and a **complex number** for all negative **x**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Derivative of the square root\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA derivative of a function tells us how fast this function changes with its\\\\\\\\nargument. One of the simplest examples in physics is the position of an object\\\\\\\\nand its velocity (the rate of change of position). Let\\\\\\\\\\'s say that the function\\\\\\\\n**x(t)** describes how the distance of the moving car from a specific point\\\\\\\\nchanges with time **t**. Do you know what determines how fast the change is in\\\\\\\\nyour distance traveled? The answer is the speed of the car! So the derivative\\\\\\\\nof the position **x(t)** is velocity **v(t)**(velocity can depend on time\\\\\\\\ntoo). To denote the derivative, we usually use the apostrophe **v(t) = x\\\\\\\\\\'(t)**\\\\\\\\nor the derivative symbol **v(t) = dx(t)/dt**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe derivative of the general function **f(x)** is not always easy to\\\\\\\\ncalculate. However, in some circumstances, if the function takes a specific\\\\\\\\nform, we\\\\\\\\\\'ve got some formulas. For example, if\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**f(x) = x n**,\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nwhere **n** is any real number, the derivative is as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**f\\\\\\\\\\'(x) = n × x(n-1)**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIt may not look like it, but this answers the question **what is the\\\\\\\\nderivative of a square root**. Do you remember the alternative (exponential)\\\\\\\\nform of a square root? Let us remind you:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√x = x(1/2)**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYou can see that in this case, **n = 1/2** , so the derivative of a square\\\\\\\\nroot is:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**(√x)\\\\\\\\\\' = (x(1/2))\\\\\\\\\\' = 1/2 × x(-1/2) = 1/(2√x)**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince a number to a negative power is one over that number, the estimation of\\\\\\\\nthe derivation will involve fractions. We\\\\\\\\\\'ve got a tool that could be\\\\\\\\nessential when adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators. It\\\\\\\\nis called the LCM calculator, and it tells you how to find the Least Common\\\\\\\\nMultiple.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe derivative of a square root is needed to obtain the coefficients in the\\\\\\\\nso-called **Taylor expansion**. We don\\\\\\\\\\'t want to dive into details too deeply,\\\\\\\\nso briefly, the Taylor series allows you to **approximate various functions**\\\\\\\\nwith the polynomials that are much easier to calculate. For example, the\\\\\\\\nTaylor expansion of **√(1 + x)** about the point **x = 0** is given by:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√(1 + x) = 1 + 1/2 × x - 1/8 × x² + 1/16 × x³ - 5/128 × x⁴ + ...** ,\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nwhich is valid for **-1 ≤ x ≤ 1**. Although the above expression has an\\\\\\\\ninfinite number of terms, to get the approximate value, you can use just a few\\\\\\\\nfirst terms. Let\\\\\\\\\\'s try it! With **x = 0.5** and the first five terms, you get:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√(1.5) = 1 + 1/2 × 0.5 - 1/8 × 0.25 + 1/16 × 0.125 - 5/128 × 0.0625** ,\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**√(1.5) ≈ 1.2241** ,\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nand the real value, provided by our calculator, is **√(1.5) ≈ 1.2247**. Close\\\\\\\\nenough!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThat was a lot of maths and equations so far. For those of you who are\\\\\\\\npersistent enough, we\\\\\\\\\\'ve prepared the next section, which explains how to\\\\\\\\ncalculate the square root of a negative number.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Square root of a negative number\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt school, you probably have been taught that the square root of a negative\\\\\\\\nnumber does not exist. This is true when you consider only real numbers. A\\\\\\\\nlong time ago, to perform advanced calculations, mathematicians had to\\\\\\\\nintroduce a more general set of numbers – the **complex numbers**. They can be\\\\\\\\nexpressed in the following form:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**x = a + b × i** ,\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nwhere **x** is the complex number with the real part **a** and the imaginary\\\\\\\\npart **b**. What differs between a complex number and a real one is the\\\\\\\\nimaginary number **i**. Here you have some examples of complex numbers: **2 +\\\\\\\\n3i** , **5i** , **1.5 + 4i** , and **2**. You may be surprised to see **2**\\\\\\\\nthere, which is a real number. Yes, it is, but it is also a complex number\\\\\\\\nwith **b = 0**. **Complex numbers are a generalization of real numbers.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo far, the imaginary number **i** is probably still a mystery for you. What\\\\\\\\nis it at all? Well, although it may look weird, it is defined by the following\\\\\\\\nequation:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**i = √(-1)** ,\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nand that\\\\\\\\\\'s all that you need to calculate the square root of every number,\\\\\\\\nwhether it is positive or not. Let\\\\\\\\\\'s see some examples:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of -9: **√(-9) = √(-1 × 9) = √(-1)√9 = 3i** ;\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of -13: **√(-13) = √(-1 × 13) = √(-1)√13 = i√13** ; and\\\\\\\\n  * Square root of -49: **√(-49) = √(-1 × 49) = √(-1)√49 = 7i**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIsn\\\\\\\\\\'t that simple? This problem doesn\\\\\\\\\\'t arise with the cube root since you can\\\\\\\\nobtain the negative number by multiplying three of the identical negative\\\\\\\\nnumbers (which you can\\\\\\\\\\'t do with two negative numbers). For example:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**³√(-64) = ³√[(-4)×(-4)×(-4)] = -4**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAnd that\\\\\\\\\\'s all you need to know about square roots!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFAQs\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Can a number have more than one square root?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nYes, in fact, **all positive numbers have 2 square roots** , one that is\\\\\\\\npositive and another that is equal but negative to the first. This is because\\\\\\\\nif you multiply two negatives together, the negatives cancel, and the result\\\\\\\\nis positive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### How do you find the square root without a calculator?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere\\\\\\\\\\'s how to find the square root of a number without a calculator:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  1. **Make an estimate** of the square root. The closest square number is acceptable if you’re at a loss.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  2. Divide the number you want to find the square root of by the estimate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  3. Add the estimate to the result of step 2.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  4. Divide the result of step 3 by 2. **This is your new estimate**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  5. Repeat steps 2-4 with your new estimate. The more times this is repeated, the more accurate the result is.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### How can I estimate square roots?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo estimate the square root of a number:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  1. Find the **nearest square number above and below** the number you are thinking of.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  2. The square root will be **between** the square roots of these numbers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  3. The **closeness** of the number to a square root indicates how close the root is. For example, 26 is very close to 25, so the root will be very close to 5.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  4. **Try a few times to get the hang of it**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Is the square root of 2 a rational number?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNo, **the square root of 2 is not rational**. This is because when 2 is\\\\\\\\nwritten as a fraction, 2/1, it can never have only even exponents, and\\\\\\\\ntherefore a rational number cannot have been squared to create it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### How can I get rid of a square root?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn algebra, **squaring both sides of the equation will get rid of any square\\\\\\\\nroots**. The result of this operation is that the square roots will be\\\\\\\\nreplaced with whatever number they were finding the square root of.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Are square roots rational?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Some square roots are rational** , whereas others are not. You can work out\\\\\\\\nif a square root is rational or not by finding out if the number you are\\\\\\\\nsquare rooting can be expressed in terms of only even exponents (e.g., 4 = 22\\\\\\\\n/ 12). If it can, its root is rational.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Is the square root of 5 a rational number?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe square root of 5 is not a rational number. This is because 5 cannot be\\\\\\\\nexpressed as a fraction where both the numerator and denominator have even\\\\\\\\nexponents. This means that a rational number cannot have been squared to get\\\\\\\\n5.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Is the square root of 7 a rational number?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe result of square rooting 7 is an irrational number. 7 cannot be written as\\\\\\\\na fraction with only even exponents, meaning that the number squared to reach\\\\\\\\n7 cannot be expressed as a fraction of integers and therefore is not rational.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### What is the derivative of the square root of x?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe derivative of square root x is x-1/2 / 2, or 1/(2√x). This is because the\\\\\\\\nsquare root of x can be expressed as x1/2, from which differentiation occurs\\\\\\\\nnormally.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### How do you find the square root of a decimal?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo find the square root of a decimal:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  1. Convert the **decimal into a fraction**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  2. **Find** any square roots of the fraction or estimate it. **Make** the fraction equal to the square root you found squared.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  3. **Cancel the square root** and the square leaving you with the fraction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  4. **Rewrite** the fraction as a decimal as your final answer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRelated calculators\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLeast Common Multiple CalculatorAbsolute Value Calculator\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNumber\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSquare root\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nShare result\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nReload calculator\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCheck out 75 similar arithmetic calculators ➗\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAbsolute changeAbsolute valueAdding and subtracting fractions...72 more\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCalculator categories\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Biology\\\\\\\\n  * Chemistry\\\\\\\\n  * Construction\\\\\\\\n  * Conversion\\\\\\\\n  * Ecology\\\\\\\\n  * Everyday life\\\\\\\\n  * Finance\\\\\\\\n  * Food\\\\\\\\n  * Health\\\\\\\\n  * Math\\\\\\\\n  * Physics\\\\\\\\n  * Sports\\\\\\\\n  * Statistics\\\\\\\\n  * Other\\\\\\\\n  * Discover Omni\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPress\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Editorial policies\\\\\\\\n  * Journalist\\\\\\\\\\'s Guide to Numbers\\\\\\\\n  * Partnerships\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMeet Omni\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * About\\\\\\\\n  * Blog\\\\\\\\n  * Contact\\\\\\\\n  * We\\\\\\\\\\'re hiring!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOmni Calculator on FacebookOmni Calculator on YouTubeOmni Calculator on\\\\\\\\nTwitterOmni Calculator on LinkedInOmni Calculator on Instagram\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEnglish\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * English\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Spanish (Español)\\\\\\\\n  * German (Deutsch)\\\\\\\\n  * French (Français)\\\\\\\\n  * Portuguese (Português)\\\\\\\\n  * Italian (Italiano)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\u200b\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nPrivacy, Cookies & Terms of ServiceCopyright by Omni Calculator sp. z o.o.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\')] </documenet>\"]}', name='search_web', id='aa3913ff-92af-4986-b7ba-a3e93160e994', tool_call_id='toolu_bdrk_01Df2ir7tKqa1nC2941X6vUY')]}})\n",

Economy\\\\n  2. Articles\\\\n\\\\n# How does Gross Domestic Product differ by state?\\\\n\\\\nFive states, including California and Florida, each contributed over $1\\\\ntrillion to the national gross domestic product in 2022.\\\\n\\\\nUpdated December 5, 2023 by the USAFacts team\\\\n\\\\nThe real US gross domestic product (GDP) — the value of all goods and services\\\\nproduced in the US, adjusted for inflation to make GDP comparable over time —\\\\nincreased by 1.9% in 2022. In today’s dollars (also known as nominal GDP), the\\\\nnational GDP surpassed $25 trillion for the first time in history.\\\\n\\\\nThe real GDP, $21.82 trillion in 2022, has increased by 5.5% since 2019\\\\n($20.69 trillion). But 2022 had a slower annual growth rate than 2021, when\\\\nthe US recorded its highest annual GDP growth rate in 37 years — an increase\\\\nof 5.8%, from $20.23 trillion in 2020 to $21.41 trillion in 2021.\\\\n\\\\n## **Which states contribute the most and the least to the GDP?**\\\\n\\\\nCalifornia, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois had the nation’s highest\\\\nGDPs in both 2022 and 2021. Each recorded a state GDP of over $1 trillion, the\\\\nonly states in the country to reach that mark. Combined, these five states\\\\ncontributed approximately 41% of the national GDP.\\\\n\\\\nThe states with the lowest GDPs include Vermont, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and\\\\nSouth Dakota, also the same in both 2022 and 2021. The combined GDP of these\\\\nstates accounts for 1.1% of the US GDP.\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n### Subscribe to get unbiased, data-driven insights sent to your inbox weekly.\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n## **Is GDP per capita a better measure?**\\\\n\\\\nNot all states contribute to the GDP equally — more-populated states tend to\\\\ncontribute more than less-populated ones. But the productivity and income of\\\\neach state\\'s economy matter. GDP per capita (per person) adjusts for\\\\ndifferences in population size, and is a better measure of states’ economic\\\\nactivity and standards of living.\\\\n\\\\n### Which states have the highest and lowest GDP per capita?\\\\n\\\\nIn 2022, the real GDP per capita was highest in New York ($104,100), the only\\\\nstate that topped $100,000. Other more-populated states with high GDPs per\\\\ncapita also rank highly in total GDP, such as California (first in total,\\\\nfourth per person), but many less-populated states have lower total GDPs but\\\\nmuch higher GDPs per capita:\\\\n\\\\n  * Massachusetts — 12th in total GDP, but 2nd in GDP per capita ($99,035) \\\\n  * North Dakota — 45th in total GDP, but 5th in GDP per capita ($93,231)\\\\n  * Delaware — 42nd in total GDP, but 7th in GDP per capita ($88,579)\\\\n\\\\n## **What is each state’s biggest contributor to the nation’s GDP?**\\\\n\\\\nNearly half of the 2022 US GDP was generated by four industries: real estate\\\\nand rental and leasing (13.2%), professional and business services (12.9%),\\\\ngovernment and government enterprises (11.4%), and manufacturing (10.3%).\\\\n\\\\nManufacturing is the top contributor for 12 states, and real estate is the top\\\\ncontributor in another 12. Professional and business services — including\\\\nindustries like finance and insurance — contribute the most to the GDPs of 10\\\\nstates, including several of the largest contributors to national GDP, such as\\\\nCalifornia and Illinois.\\\\n\\\\nIn North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming, the mining, quarrying, and oil\\\\nand gas extraction industries contribute the most to state GDPs.\\\\n\\\\nTwo states had unique top contributors: In Washington, the information sector\\\\n— which includes broadcasting, telecommunications, and data processing\\\\nservices — contributes the most. And in Nevada, the arts, entertainment,\\\\nrecreation, accommodation, and food services industries are the largest\\\\ncontributor to the state GDP.\\\\n\\\\nState economies have different strengths based on their natural resources and\\\\ncore industries. For example, Washington, DC, is the home of much of the\\\\nfederal government. Government and governmental enterprises are its biggest\\\\ncontributors.\\\\n\\\\n## **How have state GDPs changed since the pandemic?**\\\\n\\\\nFrom 2021 to 2022, real GDP increased in 43 states and Washington, DC, led by\\\\nFlorida (4.6%), Idaho (4.2%), and Tennessee (3.9%). Twenty-one states recorded\\\\nannual GDP increases of 2% or greater.\\\\n\\\\nOf the eight states that experienced either flat or declining annual growth in\\\\nGDP in 2022, none declined more than 2.4%.\\\\n\\\\nComparing state GDPs between 2019 and 2022 offers insight into current\\\\neconomic activity compared to pre-pandemic levels. Seven states had a lower\\\\nGDP in 2022 than in 2019. North Dakota, Louisiana, Hawaii, and Oklahoma have\\\\nexperienced the biggest declines since 2019. At the same time, Florida, Idaho,\\\\nArizona, Tennessee, and Utah all recorded increases in state real GDP of more\\\\nthan 10%.\\\\n\\\\n_Learn more about_ _gross domestic product_ _, read about_ _how income tax\\\\ndiffers between states_ _, and get the latest data by_ _signing up for our\\\\nnewsletter_ _._\\\\n\\\\nRecent economy articles\\\\n\\\\nRead data analyses written by the USAFacts team.\\\\n\\\\n  * #### Which Americans are struggling to make ends meet?\\\\n\\\\n  * #### How long do Americans stay at their jobs?\\\\n\\\\n  * #### How many people work for the federal government?\\\\n\\\\n## Page sources and methodology\\\\n\\\\nAll of the data on the page was sourced directly from government agencies.

This research reveals that Latinas outpace their gender and ethnic\\\\\\\\npeers in key economic measures, including record levels of Latina workforce\\\\\\\\nparticipation, educational attainment, and income growth. It reveals that\\\\\\\\nLatinas are drivers of much-needed economic vitality for the nation,”_ said\\\\\\\\n**Dr. Fienup** _**.**_  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe key findings in the U.S. Latina GDP Report include:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * **Economic Output**\\\\\\\\n  * The total economic output of U.S. Latinas is $1.3 trillion in 2021, up from $661 billion in 2010, and larger than the economies of all other states except California, Texas and New York.\\\\\\\\n  * From 2010 to 2021 real U.S. Latina GDP increased a total of 51.1% compared to only 18.8% for non-Hispanic GDP. In other words, the GDP of U.S. Latinas is growing 2.7 times faster.\\\\\\\\n  * **Labor Force Participation**\\\\\\\\n  * From 2010 to 2021, the number of Hispanic females in the U.S. labor force grew a total of 32.9% compared to only 2.7 percent for non-Hispanic females. Despite being just 9.3% of the U.S. population, Latinas are responsible for 30.2% of the growth of the U.S. labor force since 2010.\\\\\\\\n  * From 2000 to 2021, the Latina labor force participation rate increased 7.5 percentage points, while the rate for non-Hispanic females was flat. U.S. Latinas, who started the century with a participation rate a full 5.0 percentage points lower, are now 2.5 percentage points more likely to be actively working than their non-Hispanic female counterparts.\\\\\\\\n  * **Educational Attainment**\\\\\\\\n  * The number of Latinas with a bachelor’s degree or higher education increased 103% between 2010 and 2021, while the number of highly-educated non-Hispanic females increased only 38.3%. Latina educational attainment is growing 2.7 times faster than that of non-Hispanic females.\\\\\\\\n  * **Real Income**\\\\\\\\n  * From 2010 to 2021, the real incomes of U.S. Latinas grew a total of 46.0 percent compared to only 18.5 percent for Non-Hispanic females. In other words, Latina income growth is 2.5 times that of their Non-Hispanic female counterparts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_“U.S. Latinas coming of age and entering the U.S. labor force are\\\\\\\\noverwhelmingly second- and third-generation Americans. These daughters and\\\\\\\\ngranddaughters of immigrants are combining the extraordinary and selfless work\\\\\\\\nethic of their elders with rapid growth of human capital to give life to the\\\\\\\\nU.S. economy,”_ said **Dr. Hayes Bautista**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis data builds directly upon six annual U.S. Latino GDP Reports as well as\\\\\\\\neight State and a dozen Metro Area Latino GDP Reports released since 2018.\\\\\\\\nUsing publicly available data from major U.S. agencies, those reports reveal\\\\\\\\nthat Latinos are drivers of economic growth and a critical source of\\\\\\\\nresilience for broader U.S. economy. They document substantial economic growth\\\\\\\\npremiums enjoyed by Latinos of all genders, relative to non-Latinos in the\\\\\\\\nU.S.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, labor force growth of male and female Hispanics in the U.S. is\\\\\\\\nnine times the growth of the non-Hispanic labor force. Real Latino GDP growth\\\\\\\\nis 2.5 times the growth of non-Latino GDP. These premiums exist across a wide\\\\\\\\nrange of economic indicators – labor force participation, educational\\\\\\\\nattainment, real income, consumption, and more.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**To download the full report, please visit:**www.LatinaGDP.us\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe U.S. Latina GDP Report is produced by the Latino GDP Project, a project of\\\\\\\\nCommunity Partners (www.CommunityPartners.org) with the Center for Economic\\\\\\\\nResearch & Forecasting at California Lutheran University (www.clucerf.org) and\\\\\\\\nthe Center for the Study of Latino Health & Culture at UCLA\\\\\\\\n(www.uclahealth.org/ceslac).

Despite being just 9.3% of the U.S. population, Latinas are responsible for 30.2% of the growth of the U.S. labor force since 2010.\\\\\\\\n  * From 2000 to 2021, the Latina labor force participation rate increased 7.5 percentage points, while the rate for non-Hispanic females was flat. U.S. Latinas, who started the century with a participation rate a full 5.0 percentage points lower, are now 2.5 percentage points more likely to be actively working than their non-Hispanic female counterparts.\\\\\\\\n  * **Educational Attainment**\\\\\\\\n  * The number of Latinas with a bachelor’s degree or higher education increased 103% between 2010 and 2021, while the number of highly-educated non-Hispanic females increased only 38.3%. Latina educational attainment is growing 2.7 times faster than that of non-Hispanic females.\\\\\\\\n  * **Real Income**\\\\\\\\n  * From 2010 to 2021, the real incomes of U.S. Latinas grew a total of 46.0 percent compared to only 18.5 percent for Non-Hispanic females. In other words, Latina income growth is 2.5 times that of their Non-Hispanic female counterparts.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_“U.S. Latinas coming of age and entering the U.S. labor force are\\\\\\\\noverwhelmingly second- and third-generation Americans. These daughters and\\\\\\\\ngranddaughters of immigrants are combining the extraordinary and selfless work\\\\\\\\nethic of their elders with rapid growth of human capital to give life to the\\\\\\\\nU.S. economy,”_ said **Dr. Hayes Bautista**.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis data builds directly upon six annual U.S. Latino GDP Reports as well as\\\\\\\\neight State and a dozen Metro Area Latino GDP Reports released since 2018.\\\\\\\\nUsing publicly available data from major U.S. agencies, those reports reveal\\\\\\\\nthat Latinos are drivers of economic growth and a critical source of\\\\\\\\nresilience for broader U.S. economy. They document substantial economic growth\\\\\\\\npremiums enjoyed by Latinos of all genders, relative to non-Latinos in the\\\\\\\\nU.S.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor example, labor force growth of male and female Hispanics in the U.S. is\\\\\\\\nnine times the growth of the non-Hispanic labor force. Real Latino GDP growth\\\\\\\\nis 2.5 times the growth of non-Latino GDP. These premiums exist across a wide\\\\\\\\nrange of economic indicators – labor force participation, educational\\\\\\\\nattainment, real income, consumption, and more.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**To download the full report, please visit:**www.LatinaGDP.us\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe U.S. Latina GDP Report is produced by the Latino GDP Project, a project of\\\\\\\\nCommunity Partners (www.CommunityPartners.org) with the Center for Economic\\\\\\\\nResearch & Forecasting at California Lutheran University (www.clucerf.org) and\\\\\\\\nthe Center for the Study of Latino Health & Culture at UCLA\\\\\\\\n(www.uclahealth.org/ceslac).

Economy\\\\\\\\n  2. Articles\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# How does Gross Domestic Product differ by state?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFive states, including California and Florida, each contributed over $1\\\\\\\\ntrillion to the national gross domestic product in 2022.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpdated December 5, 2023 by the USAFacts team\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe real US gross domestic product (GDP) — the value of all goods and services\\\\\\\\nproduced in the US, adjusted for inflation to make GDP comparable over time —\\\\\\\\nincreased by 1.9% in 2022. In today’s dollars (also known as nominal GDP), the\\\\\\\\nnational GDP surpassed $25 trillion for the first time in history.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe real GDP, $21.82 trillion in 2022, has increased by 5.5% since 2019\\\\\\\\n($20.69 trillion). But 2022 had a slower annual growth rate than 2021, when\\\\\\\\nthe US recorded its highest annual GDP growth rate in 37 years — an increase\\\\\\\\nof 5.8%, from $20.23 trillion in 2020 to $21.41 trillion in 2021.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## **Which states contribute the most and the least to the GDP?**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCalifornia, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois had the nation’s highest\\\\\\\\nGDPs in both 2022 and 2021. Each recorded a state GDP of over $1 trillion, the\\\\\\\\nonly states in the country to reach that mark. Combined, these five states\\\\\\\\ncontributed approximately 41% of the national GDP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe states with the lowest GDPs include Vermont, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and\\\\\\\\nSouth Dakota, also the same in both 2022 and 2021. The combined GDP of these\\\\\\\\nstates accounts for 1.1% of the US GDP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Subscribe to get unbiased, data-driven insights sent to your inbox weekly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## **Is GDP per capita a better measure?**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNot all states contribute to the GDP equally — more-populated states tend to\\\\\\\\ncontribute more than less-populated ones. But the productivity and income of\\\\\\\\neach state\\'s economy matter. GDP per capita (per person) adjusts for\\\\\\\\ndifferences in population size, and is a better measure of states’ economic\\\\\\\\nactivity and standards of living.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Which states have the highest and lowest GDP per capita?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2022, the real GDP per capita was highest in New York ($104,100), the only\\\\\\\\nstate that topped $100,000. Other more-populated states with high GDPs per\\\\\\\\ncapita also rank highly in total GDP, such as California (first in total,\\\\\\\\nfourth per person), but many less-populated states have lower total GDPs but\\\\\\\\nmuch higher GDPs per capita:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Massachusetts — 12th in total GDP, but 2nd in GDP per capita ($99,035) \\\\\\\\n  * North Dakota — 45th in total GDP, but 5th in GDP per capita ($93,231)\\\\\\\\n  * Delaware — 42nd in total GDP, but 7th in GDP per capita ($88,579)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## **What is each state’s biggest contributor to the nation’s GDP?**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNearly half of the 2022 US GDP was generated by four industries: real estate\\\\\\\\nand rental and leasing (13.2%), professional and business services (12.9%),\\\\\\\\ngovernment and government enterprises (11.4%), and manufacturing (10.3%).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManufacturing is the top contributor for 12 states, and real estate is the top\\\\\\\\ncontributor in another 12. Professional and business services — including\\\\\\\\nindustries like finance and insurance — contribute the most to the GDPs of 10\\\\\\\\nstates, including several of the largest contributors to national GDP, such as\\\\\\\\nCalifornia and Illinois.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming, the mining, quarrying, and oil\\\\\\\\nand gas extraction industries contribute the most to state GDPs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTwo states had unique top contributors: In Washington, the information sector\\\\\\\\n— which includes broadcasting, telecommunications, and data processing\\\\\\\\nservices — contributes the most. And in Nevada, the arts, entertainment,\\\\\\\\nrecreation, accommodation, and food services industries are the largest\\\\\\\\ncontributor to the state GDP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nState economies have different strengths based on their natural resources and\\\\\\\\ncore industries. For example, Washington, DC, is the home of much of the\\\\\\\\nfederal government. Government and governmental enterprises are its biggest\\\\\\\\ncontributors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## **How have state GDPs changed since the pandemic?**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom 2021 to 2022, real GDP increased in 43 states and Washington, DC, led by\\\\\\\\nFlorida (4.6%), Idaho (4.2%), and Tennessee (3.9%). Twenty-one states recorded\\\\\\\\nannual GDP increases of 2% or greater.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOf the eight states that experienced either flat or declining annual growth in\\\\\\\\nGDP in 2022, none declined more than 2.4%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nComparing state GDPs between 2019 and 2022 offers insight into current\\\\\\\\neconomic activity compared to pre-pandemic levels. Seven states had a lower\\\\\\\\nGDP in 2022 than in 2019. North Dakota, Louisiana, Hawaii, and Oklahoma have\\\\\\\\nexperienced the biggest declines since 2019. At the same time, Florida, Idaho,\\\\\\\\nArizona, Tennessee, and Utah all recorded increases in state real GDP of more\\\\\\\\nthan 10%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Learn more about_ _gross domestic product_ _, read about_ _how income tax\\\\\\\\ndiffers between states_ _, and get the latest data by_ _signing up for our\\\\\\\\nnewsletter_ _._\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRecent economy articles\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRead data analyses written by the USAFacts team.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * #### Which Americans are struggling to make ends meet?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * #### How long do Americans stay at their jobs?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * #### How many people work for the federal government?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page sources and methodology\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll of the data on the page was sourced directly from government agencies.

Articles\\\\n\\\\n# How does Gross Domestic Product differ by state?\\\\n\\\\nFive states, including California and Florida, each contributed over $1\\\\ntrillion to the national gross domestic product in 2022.\\\\n\\\\nUpdated December 5, 2023 by the USAFacts team\\\\n\\\\nThe real US gross domestic product (GDP) — the value of all goods and services\\\\nproduced in the US, adjusted for inflation to make GDP comparable over time —\\\\nincreased by 1.9% in 2022. In today’s dollars (also known as nominal GDP), the\\\\nnational GDP surpassed $25 trillion for the first time in history.\\\\n\\\\nThe real GDP, $21.82 trillion in 2022, has increased by 5.5% since 2019\\\\n($20.69 trillion). But 2022 had a slower annual growth rate than 2021, when\\\\nthe US recorded its highest annual GDP growth rate in 37 years — an increase\\\\nof 5.8%, from $20.23 trillion in 2020 to $21.41 trillion in 2021.\\\\n\\\\n## **Which states contribute the most and the least to the GDP?**\\\\n\\\\nCalifornia, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois had the nation’s highest\\\\nGDPs in both 2022 and 2021. Each recorded a state GDP of over $1 trillion, the\\\\nonly states in the country to reach that mark. Combined, these five states\\\\ncontributed approximately 41% of the national GDP.\\\\n\\\\nThe states with the lowest GDPs include Vermont, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and\\\\nSouth Dakota, also the same in both 2022 and 2021. The combined GDP of these\\\\nstates accounts for 1.1% of the US GDP.\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n### Subscribe to get unbiased, data-driven insights sent to your inbox weekly.\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n## **Is GDP per capita a better measure?**\\\\n\\\\nNot all states contribute to the GDP equally — more-populated states tend to\\\\ncontribute more than less-populated ones. But the productivity and income of\\\\neach state\\'s economy matter. GDP per capita (per person) adjusts for\\\\ndifferences in population size, and is a better measure of states’ economic\\\\nactivity and standards of living.\\\\n\\\\n### Which states have the highest and lowest GDP per capita?\\\\n\\\\nIn 2022, the real GDP per capita was highest in New York ($104,100), the only\\\\nstate that topped $100,000. Other more-populated states with high GDPs per\\\\ncapita also rank highly in total GDP, such as California (first in total,\\\\nfourth per person), but many less-populated states have lower total GDPs but\\\\nmuch higher GDPs per capita:\\\\n\\\\n  * Massachusetts — 12th in total GDP, but 2nd in GDP per capita ($99,035) \\\\n  * North Dakota — 45th in total GDP, but 5th in GDP per capita ($93,231)\\\\n  * Delaware — 42nd in total GDP, but 7th in GDP per capita ($88,579)\\\\n\\\\n## **What is each state’s biggest contributor to the nation’s GDP?**\\\\n\\\\nNearly half of the 2022 US GDP was generated by four industries: real estate\\\\nand rental and leasing (13.2%), professional and business services (12.9%),\\\\ngovernment and government enterprises (11.4%), and manufacturing (10.3%).\\\\n\\\\nManufacturing is the top contributor for 12 states, and real estate is the top\\\\ncontributor in another 12. Professional and business services — including\\\\nindustries like finance and insurance — contribute the most to the GDPs of 10\\\\nstates, including several of the largest contributors to national GDP, such as\\\\nCalifornia and Illinois.\\\\n\\\\nIn North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming, the mining, quarrying, and oil\\\\nand gas extraction industries contribute the most to state GDPs.\\\\n\\\\nTwo states had unique top contributors: In Washington, the information sector\\\\n— which includes broadcasting, telecommunications, and data processing\\\\nservices — contributes the most. And in Nevada, the arts, entertainment,\\\\nrecreation, accommodation, and food services industries are the largest\\\\ncontributor to the state GDP.\\\\n\\\\nState economies have different strengths based on their natural resources and\\\\ncore industries. For example, Washington, DC, is the home of much of the\\\\nfederal government. Government and governmental enterprises are its biggest\\\\ncontributors.\\\\n\\\\n## **How have state GDPs changed since the pandemic?**\\\\n\\\\nFrom 2021 to 2022, real GDP increased in 43 states and Washington, DC, led by\\\\nFlorida (4.6%), Idaho (4.2%), and Tennessee (3.9%). Twenty-one states recorded\\\\nannual GDP increases of 2% or greater.\\\\n\\\\nOf the eight states that experienced either flat or declining annual growth in\\\\nGDP in 2022, none declined more than 2.4%.\\\\n\\\\nComparing state GDPs between 2019 and 2022 offers insight into current\\\\neconomic activity compared to pre-pandemic levels. Seven states had a lower\\\\nGDP in 2022 than in 2019. North Dakota, Louisiana, Hawaii, and Oklahoma have\\\\nexperienced the biggest declines since 2019. At the same time, Florida, Idaho,\\\\nArizona, Tennessee, and Utah all recorded increases in state real GDP of more\\\\nthan 10%.\\\\n\\\\n_Learn more about_ _gross domestic product_ _, read about_ _how income tax\\\\ndiffers between states_ _, and get the latest data by_ _signing up for our\\\\nnewsletter_ _._\\\\n\\\\nRecent economy articles\\\\n\\\\nRead data analyses written by the USAFacts team.\\\\n\\\\n  * #### Which Americans are struggling to make ends meet?\\\\n\\\\n  * #### How long do Americans stay at their jobs?\\\\n\\\\n  * #### How many people work for the federal government?\\\\n\\\\n## Page sources and methodology\\\\n\\\\nAll of the data on the page was sourced directly from government agencies.

U.S. Latinas, who started the century with a participation rate a full 5.0 percentage points lower, are now 2.5 percentage points more likely to be actively working than their non-Hispanic female counterparts.\\\\\\\\n  * **Educational Attainment**\\\\\\\\n  * The number of Latinas with a bachelor’s degree or higher education increased 103% between 2010 and 2021, while the number of highly-educated non-Hispanic females increased only 38.3%. Latina educational attainment is growing 2.7 times faster than that of non-Hispanic females.\\\\\\\\n  * **Real Income**\\\\\\\\n  * From 2010 to 2021, the real incomes of U.S. Latinas grew a total of 46.0 percent compared to only 18.5 percent for Non-Hispanic females.

Economy\\\\\\\\n  2. Articles\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# How does Gross Domestic Product differ by state?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFive states, including California and Florida, each contributed over $1\\\\\\\\ntrillion to the national gross domestic product in 2022.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUpdated December 5, 2023 by the USAFacts team\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe real US gross domestic product (GDP) — the value of all goods and services\\\\\\\\nproduced in the US, adjusted for inflation to make GDP comparable over time —\\\\\\\\nincreased by 1.9% in 2022. In today’s dollars (also known as nominal GDP), the\\\\\\\\nnational GDP surpassed $25 trillion for the first time in history.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe real GDP, $21.82 trillion in 2022, has increased by 5.5% since 2019\\\\\\\\n($20.69 trillion). But 2022 had a slower annual growth rate than 2021, when\\\\\\\\nthe US recorded its highest annual GDP growth rate in 37 years — an increase\\\\\\\\nof 5.8%, from $20.23 trillion in 2020 to $21.41 trillion in 2021.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## **Which states contribute the most and the least to the GDP?**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCalifornia, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois had the nation’s highest\\\\\\\\nGDPs in both 2022 and 2021. Each recorded a state GDP of over $1 trillion, the\\\\\\\\nonly states in the country to reach that mark. Combined, these five states\\\\\\\\ncontributed approximately 41% of the national GDP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe states with the lowest GDPs include Vermont, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and\\\\\\\\nSouth Dakota, also the same in both 2022 and 2021. The combined GDP of these\\\\\\\\nstates accounts for 1.1% of the US GDP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Subscribe to get unbiased, data-driven insights sent to your inbox weekly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n* * *\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## **Is GDP per capita a better measure?**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNot all states contribute to the GDP equally — more-populated states tend to\\\\\\\\ncontribute more than less-populated ones. But the productivity and income of\\\\\\\\neach state\\'s economy matter. GDP per capita (per person) adjusts for\\\\\\\\ndifferences in population size, and is a better measure of states’ economic\\\\\\\\nactivity and standards of living.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Which states have the highest and lowest GDP per capita?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn 2022, the real GDP per capita was highest in New York ($104,100), the only\\\\\\\\nstate that topped $100,000. Other more-populated states with high GDPs per\\\\\\\\ncapita also rank highly in total GDP, such as California (first in total,\\\\\\\\nfourth per person), but many less-populated states have lower total GDPs but\\\\\\\\nmuch higher GDPs per capita:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * Massachusetts — 12th in total GDP, but 2nd in GDP per capita ($99,035) \\\\\\\\n  * North Dakota — 45th in total GDP, but 5th in GDP per capita ($93,231)\\\\\\\\n  * Delaware — 42nd in total GDP, but 7th in GDP per capita ($88,579)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## **What is each state’s biggest contributor to the nation’s GDP?**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNearly half of the 2022 US GDP was generated by four industries: real estate\\\\\\\\nand rental and leasing (13.2%), professional and business services (12.9%),\\\\\\\\ngovernment and government enterprises (11.4%), and manufacturing (10.3%).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nManufacturing is the top contributor for 12 states, and real estate is the top\\\\\\\\ncontributor in another 12. Professional and business services — including\\\\\\\\nindustries like finance and insurance — contribute the most to the GDPs of 10\\\\\\\\nstates, including several of the largest contributors to national GDP, such as\\\\\\\\nCalifornia and Illinois.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming, the mining, quarrying, and oil\\\\\\\\nand gas extraction industries contribute the most to state GDPs.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTwo states had unique top contributors: In Washington, the information sector\\\\\\\\n— which includes broadcasting, telecommunications, and data processing\\\\\\\\nservices — contributes the most. And in Nevada, the arts, entertainment,\\\\\\\\nrecreation, accommodation, and food services industries are the largest\\\\\\\\ncontributor to the state GDP.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nState economies have different strengths based on their natural resources and\\\\\\\\ncore industries. For example, Washington, DC, is the home of much of the\\\\\\\\nfederal government. Government and governmental enterprises are its biggest\\\\\\\\ncontributors.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## **How have state GDPs changed since the pandemic?**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom 2021 to 2022, real GDP increased in 43 states and Washington, DC, led by\\\\\\\\nFlorida (4.6%), Idaho (4.2%), and Tennessee (3.9%). Twenty-one states recorded\\\\\\\\nannual GDP increases of 2% or greater.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOf the eight states that experienced either flat or declining annual growth in\\\\\\\\nGDP in 2022, none declined more than 2.4%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nComparing state GDPs between 2019 and 2022 offers insight into current\\\\\\\\neconomic activity compared to pre-pandemic levels. Seven states had a lower\\\\\\\\nGDP in 2022 than in 2019. North Dakota, Louisiana, Hawaii, and Oklahoma have\\\\\\\\nexperienced the biggest declines since 2019. At the same time, Florida, Idaho,\\\\\\\\nArizona, Tennessee, and Utah all recorded increases in state real GDP of more\\\\\\\\nthan 10%.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n_Learn more about_ _gross domestic product_ _, read about_ _how income tax\\\\\\\\ndiffers between states_ _, and get the latest data by_ _signing up for our\\\\\\\\nnewsletter_ _._\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRecent economy articles\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nRead data analyses written by the USAFacts team.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * #### Which Americans are struggling to make ends meet?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * #### How long do Americans stay at their jobs?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n  * #### How many people work for the federal government?\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Page sources and methodology\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAll of the data on the page was sourced directly from government agencies.
